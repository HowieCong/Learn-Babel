This project is for learning and practicing Babel, and sharing experiences and code examples related to Babel.

## Project Overview

Babel is a widely used JavaScript compiler that allows you to convert ES6+ code into backward-compatible JavaScript syntax, so it can run in current and older browsers or environments. This repository contains basic usage, configuration, common plugins, and transpilation examples for Babel. It is suitable for both beginners and advanced developers.

## Project Structure

- `index.js`: Main entry file with Babel transpilation examples.
- `test.js`: Script for testing Babel configuration and features.
- `package.json`: Project dependencies and scripts.
- `pnpm-lock.yaml`: Dependency lock file.

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/HowieCong/Learn-Babel.git
   cd Learn-Babel
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pnpm install
   # or use npm install
   ```
3. Run examples or tests:
   ```bash
   node index.js
   node test.js
   ```

## Babel Learning Topics

- Basic principles and purpose of Babel
- Babel configuration files (e.g., .babelrc, babel.config.js)
- Common Babel plugins and presets
- How to transpile ES6+ code to compatible code
- Practical cases and common issues

## Experience Sharing

- It is recommended to learn ES6+ features first, then understand Babel's transpilation principles
- Try configuring Babel in real projects to understand the role of each plugin and preset
- For compatibility issues, refer to the official Babel documentation and community experience
